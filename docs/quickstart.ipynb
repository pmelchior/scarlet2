In addition to the actual science image cube, you can and often must provide weights for all elements in the data cube, an image cube of the PSF model (one image for all or one for each channel), an `astropy.WCS` structure to translate from pixel to sky coordinates, and labels for all channels. The reason for specifying them is to enable the code to internally map from the model frame, in which you seek to fit a model, to the observed data frame."
