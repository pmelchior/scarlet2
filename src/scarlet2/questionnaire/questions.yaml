  - question: Do you have a single image, or multiple images?

          - question: Do you wish to model transient or variable sources across multiple epochs?

                commentary: "For each image, the channels should be a list of tuples where each tuple provides the filter and an epoch identifier which is unique for each image of a particular filter. For example, you might have two g-band images from different times, which would be initialized separately with `channels=[(‘g’,0)]` and `channels=[(‘g’,1’)]`. You might have two other r-band images taken at different times again. These would be initialized with `channels=[(‘r’,0)]` and `channels=[(‘r’,1’)]`. You may wish to take note of any epochs where the transient is known to be ‘off’ - you can add this constraint later if desired."

                        commentary: "If you find performance or memory issues for a large number of epochs, you might consider pre-aligning them with a tool such as [SWarp](https://www.astromatic.net/software/swarp/) to improve modeling speed."

                commentary: "Before initializing sources as ‘static’ or ‘variable’, we need to set up the ability to parse the filters and epochs of the channels. We can do that by defining the following. Let’s say our observations were given channels like (‘g’,0). Then we would set up the following like above."
